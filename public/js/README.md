# 📁 CeyQuest JavaScript Files

This folder contains all JavaScript code extracted from HTML files.

## 📋 Files Overview

- `faq_script_3.js`
- `main.js`
- `navigation-test_script_3.js`

## 🔗 Usage

Each HTML file now references these JavaScript files externally instead of having inline scripts.

## 📝 Notes

- All JavaScript has been extracted from HTML files
- Files are named based on their source HTML file and content
- Main functionality is in `main.js`
- External scripts (CDN, Framer) remain unchanged
